After years of Wordpress usage I'm jumping on the static HTML wagon. Why? Nowadays I write mostly in Markdown. I use Strapdown for basic documentation and during a meeting I find it a lot easier to have a basic editor open (like vim) than a full blown text processor. Static site generators have become a lot more mature lately, so it's an easy win for me. I can write my posts while offline (which I couldn't do with Wordpress) and push them to git when I'm online. All in all, it's a lot easier. It's one of the things that kept me from writing articles, as I couldn't do it whenever I felt like it: I had to have an internet connection. Now I can just write when I feel like it.
I won't enable commenting: Twitter integration is present and I'd rather see someone write a nice reply article or blog post than a 2-sentence meaningless comment. So if you disagree, feel free to tweet your reply. It's just too much a pain in the ass to find a decent commenting system for a static site which isn't proprietary.

Content will be ported as time goes along. I'll also post some Dutch content, mainly my opinion on current events. If it's relevant to non-Dutch speakers, I'll post a translated version as well.
