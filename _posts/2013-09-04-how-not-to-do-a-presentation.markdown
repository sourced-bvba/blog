In a couple of months I'll get to experience what I think will be one of the defining moments in my life: becoming a father for the first time. Today I can say I seriously underestimated all the preparation that comes with this event. A lot of stuff needs to be done, and as a first-time father a lot of information needs to be gathered. Which coincidentally brings me to the subject of my post.

At our regular hospital 4 sessions are given to new parents in order to give them as much information as possible. The presentations are given by resident gyneacologists. Yesterday we went to the first of the 4 sessions and it's safe to say: this was by far one of the worst presentations I've ever seen. It wasn't the underlying content of the presentation, most subjects were handled. However, the way the information was presented and how it was presented, it made me twitch.<!-- more -->

So without further ado, my tips on how to royally screw up a presentation, inspired by yesterday's presentation (and other awesome presentations).

### Make your own PowerPoint background template

The built in PowerPoint templates are abysmal, and there's a designer in us all anyways. Plain unicolor background are so passé. With current day PowerPoint versions, there's no limit with what you can do. Your background should scream 'I AM AWESOME'. The use of gradients is a given, the more the merrier. And don't forget colors. Heavy contrasting or flashy colors on backgrounds are real eye-catchers and sparkle the imagination of your viewers. My recommendations: stick to the basics colors of the spectrum: red (FF0000), green (00FF00) or blue (0000FF). 

### No contrasting colors for your text

If you have a yellow background using white for your text color should be your default. The same goes for blue on a red background (or vice versa, same awesomeness). If you have a dark gray background, stick to black text. This will discourage people to print your presentation and help save the environment. Oh, and don't forget that there's no limit on how many text colors you can use in a slide.

### People love to read slides

Nobody listens to the presenter. In most cases, organisers just plucked a stranger from the street and ordered him to read the slides aloud. So you should pack as much information on your slides as possible. Multiple header levels, bullets, even packing more text outside of a paragraph in order to fill up some whitespace, they're all hallmarks of really great presentations.

### Never prepare

You'll never have the same audience and every audience is different. So why on earth should you prepare for such a diverse listener group? In any case, most audiences can read and if you've followed my previous advice your role will be that of an equivalent of the newspaper reader in Cuban sigar factories. Your job is to manage the pace your audience needs to read your slides.

### Allow for interruptions

If people have questions, allow for them to interrupt your presentation and state their burning conundrum. Flow is really overrated and who knows, the question may be about something you'll handle in a couple of minutes and some slides ahead. Allowing for questions in presentations has two things going for it: chances are you'll get the opportunity to shortcut your presentation and you'll get use the fantastic 'skip 4 slides ahead, answer the question and then go 4 slides back'-technique. Linear presentations are so passé anyways.

### Skip slides

Like I said, every audience is different and a main rule for presentations is that you need to adapt your presentation to the smartest person in the room. These are the people that matter and you don't want to bore them small details or irrelevant facts. So feel free to skip slides if you think you'll bore someone in the audience. The only time you'll show all the slides is when you're presenting to an entire room of idiots. If you're lucky, your room is packed with Einsteins and you'll be able to limit your presentation to your personal introduction.

### Advertise where you can

You have the entire screen real estate to yourself. So include a logo on every page! You'll never know someone will walk in in the middle of your presentation and not know what company is presenting. Presentation are the ideal moment to advertise a product or company, so make the most out of it.


If you follow all my rules, you'll have succesfully screwed up your presentation as the professional you are. People will remember your presentation and wasn't that the goal in the first place.

Or you could just ignore my rules and read [Presentation Zen](http://www.amazon.com/Presentation-Zen-Simple-Design-Delivery/dp/0321525655), but you'll risk the fact that your audience will actually listen to you...
