Well, my last post caught a wee bit of attention. I think I heard it all in the last couple of days: people thinking I'm Chicken Little, saying that the sky is falling, that the situation isn't nearly as bad as I said and on the other hand people who wholeheartedly agreed with my words and some even thought I didn't go far enough. And I didn't even tweeted the link yet...

Perhaps in hindsight I could have eased off a bit on the rhetoric, but it doesn't take away the fact that I'm behind the sentiment of the article, as confronting as it might be as a developer when you read it. This article surely wasn't only meant as a pessimistic view but rather as a wake up call to whoever feels the article may be on to something, even if only for a tiny bit.

I think in 2011 I once wrote a draft that was never published, and looking at it in hindsight it seems like I already started to get a hint of what I'm aspiring to become. The gist of the article what that software teams shouldn't be managed in a factory model. It just doesn't compute with the idea that a group of developers is a living organism that should operate in the highest degree of independence, autonomy and accountibility. We can't be put into a system that degrades us into factory workers, using standardized techniques and rules, giving us a set of inputs and expecting a standardized process to receive the output. Ours is a very creative industry and we're extremely capable of delivering a quality solution without any process or organisational model. Well, that last thing isn't entirely right, we do have an organisational mode, but it grows from within the team.

Our industry needs to be more aware of things like the Dreyfus model. For those that do not know what this is, the Dreyfus model categorizes everyone into 5 distinct categories with regards to a certain competency:
- Novice
- Advanced Beginner
- Competent
- Proficient
- Expert
While novices need rules and procedures and they are the most efficient when people tell them how to do a certain thing. Experts on the other hand work from a intuitive perspective. They 'know' what needs to be done in order to achieve a certain goals. The problem lies in the fact that experts cannot always communicate why they do something a certain way, they just know it's the right way. The levels in between show a rise in intuitive capacity and also a rise in perceived chaos to the outside world.

Most software craftsmen are located in the top 3 categories, because software craftsmanship requires a certain level of maturity and experience and with that comes competence. Most I know are either proficient or experts in their fields. While the model seems linear, it is not. It's fairly easy to get from a novice to a proficient level of competence, but in order to get to the last two levels, it requires a certain way of thinking and organizing. The life of an expert is a very chaotic one and very different from that of a novice or advanced beginner.

What happens in our industry now is that it caters to the entire Dreyfus model. You can perfectly enter our industry as a novice and gradually work your way up the Dreyfus model. Most of our industry however is hovering around the competent level. That's because rules are put into place in order to cater to the novices and advanced beginners. One of the strange implications of those rules is that they inhibit the further competence growth, as they become an slowing factor when you're at a competent level, when intuition is starting to take over. 

My article from years back poised the idea of that the most effective software development teams are like SWAT or SEAL teams. They are highly competent, most of them are proficient or experts. They can get an objective and as a team, they will organize themselves into a structure that is the most efficient for the job, based on mutual respect and a deep knowledge of each members' competences. Unfortunately this also means this is no place for a novice or an advanced beginner, because these teams work on intuition, not on a set of rules. 

Will you need such a team for all tasks? Probably not but in most cases it will be much more efficient. It would also solve a lot of the problems I put forward in my article. When you hire such a team as a client, you know that you need to relinquish control to that team. You don't second guess their decisions. You give them a target and you trust that the team will deliver (and it will). As an individual developer in the team, you cover each other's backs. You know when to say no, because the culture within the team allows you to. Software companies actually don't have big role to play in this model. Their role is to facilitate the teams in any way they can and according to the needs the team communicates to the company. A nice example for this is: if the team asks for certain training or equipment, the company facilitates. But in the ideal model, the company merely is a shell around a number of teams, relieving them of certain administrative tasks that would distract them from their main objective, which is writing software.

But what about novices and beginners, you say? Well, in my mind, there are two ways of tackling this. You can provide training to them to get them to a competent level. At that point, most teams are capable of absorbing such a person and training them further on. This also requires a certain level of commitment, but to me, that's just normal. If you're training to be a doctor and an experienced doctor is taking you under his wings, he (and the industry) requires a certain level of commitment. Gone are the days of 'laissez faire'. 
Another way is that you organize these into regular teams that are able to specialize in a certain field and take over when the SEAL team has done the groundwork. Anyone in such a team can transcend their level of competence and move into a SEAL team, given training and selection.
