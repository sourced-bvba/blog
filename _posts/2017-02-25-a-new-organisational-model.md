Well, my last post caught a wee bit of attention. I think I heard it all in the last couple of days: people thinking I'm Chicken Little, saying that the sky is falling, that the situation isn't nearly as bad as I said and on the other hand people who wholeheartedly agreed with my words and some even thought I didn't go far enough.
