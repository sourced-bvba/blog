Embracing the software crafter mindset, I love to explore new technologies and find new ways to develop software. Creating mobile applications is a part of that and I'm actually enjoying developing small applications.

To simplify things a bit, there are two ways to build mobile applications: native and hybrid. Native applications are developed in specific languages inherent to the platform. In the case of iOS application, that's Swift (or Objective-C if you're into pain) and in the case of Android that's Kotlin (or plain Java if you're into pain). The advantage of native applications is that they can use the full spectrum of functionalities offered by the hardware and you're coding as close as possible to the device so performance is much better than hybrid applications. With hybrid applications, you'll be coding in intermediate languages, such as Javascript. The output in many cases is a web application that is wrapped in web view, so you're basically writing a hybrid native web application. While this is sometimes much faster to develop, the performance is worse than a native application and you're constrained with regards to functionalities: not all native functionalities might be available to you when developing a hybrid application.

When choosing a hybrid application framework, there are a couple of popular ones: Titanium and Ionic seem to attract a lot of people. These are Javascript frameworks and for example Ionic closely relates to Angular, which makes the transition for web developers a whole lot easier. There's also React Native which allows you to build mobile applications using the React framework.

And then there is Gluon.

Gluon is a Java framework that utilizes a VM in or
