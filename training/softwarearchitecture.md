## What

Simon Brown's Software Architecture for Developers Workshop is aimed towards letting you take full advantage of the technical knowledge you already have to extend your software development skills.

You'll learn how to apply software architecture pragmatically in the real-world and not just the classic "ivory tower" software architecture. You'll define the architecture for a small software system, using small hands-on exercises along the way. You will become far more architecturally aware and will learn to build much better software.

Learn how to:

* Understand what software architecture is all about.
* Understand what it means to be a software architect and the responsibilities associated with the role.
* Understand the trade-offs that are made when making architectural decisions.
* Experience what it feels like to be an architect on a bespoke software development project; including gathering non-functional requirements determining the drivers for architecture and defining an architecture.
* Appreciate that even a little architecture can go a long way to building better software.
* Understand that, as a software architect, it's okay to do some coding.

### Learning outcomes

This 2-day workshop will give you an introduction to a pragmatic and practical approach to software architecture; including technical leadership, communication and how to balance up front design with agile approaches.

### Target audience

Software developers and architects; all levels of experience.

### Pre-requisites

Some experience building software; no laptops needed.
